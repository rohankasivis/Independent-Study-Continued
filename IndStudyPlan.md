Part 1
------

Implement the [GAP protocol](http://www.csc.kth.se/~mfd/Papers/RVK05.pdf), similar to how I implemented the original tree based protocol. Add testing classes using ScalaTest once done, and then compare performance to the original one with ScalaTest (on a local machine with multiple nodes).

Part 2
------

While implementing the protocol, begin learning clustering of nodes with regards to networking/distributed systems. Work on Akka programs after gaining a basic understanding, and investigate how Akka works with such clusters. Lastly, I will focus on various factors such as the number of clusters and how performance varies as the number changes, and so on.

Part 3
------

This is the final part which will put everything together. This will take place after both the GAP protocol is implemented and I have learned all the material in part 2. I will run through both the original tree based algorithm and the gap algorithm on akka clusters and compare their relative performance, and performance with even more algorithms if that is feasible.
